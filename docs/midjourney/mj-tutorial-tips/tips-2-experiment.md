# Tip 2: Experimenting

The above example also demonstrates a second technique - experimenting.

When you get unexpected results, don't panic. Analyze the issues,then systematically adjust the prompts. Be patient. In the prompt above, there's one part I'm not sure you noticed - the "stock photo" at the beginning. What happens if you remove those words?

```other
two Asian men in suits shaking hands,say goodbye in front of the main entrance of the office building, focus on two hands, taken with Canon, background bokeh
```

The results still meet the requirements, and the number of fingers is correct too. This shows "stock photo" doesn't have a big impact on the model.
